# E-Paper Quote Display (german)
This project utilizes a 5.83-inch black and white E-Paper display from Waveshare, driven by a Raspberry Pi.
The display is designed to show a different quote every day, primarily in German. The project consists of generating the required bitmaps using the [generateBitMaps.py](./python/scripts/generateBitMap.py) script, and then displaying the quotes on the E-Paper. 

For that to you can compile a C programm found [here](./c/src/main.c) or use the Python script found [here](./python/scripts/showQuotes.py).

WARNING! The C programm doesnâ€™t work currently, the display does not change.

## Installation

To set up the E-Paper display project, follow the steps below:
### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi with an operating system installed (e.g., Raspbian)
- Waveshare 5.83 inch E-Paper display
    - https://www.waveshare.com/5.83inch-e-Paper.htm
- Optional (but recommended):
    - E-Paper with a HAT to drive it

### Software
- Enable SPI Interface on Pi

      sudo raspi-config
      Choose Interfacing Options -> SPI -> Yes Enable SPI interface
      sudo reboot
      You can use ls /dev/spi* to check whether SPI is occupied. If the terminal outputs /dev/spidev0.1 and /dev/spidev0.1, SPI is not occupied.
- Install BCM2835, see [waveshare manual]( https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/5.83inch_e-Paper_HAT_Manual#C)
- Python 3.x installed on the Raspberry Pi
- For Python: Install the function library, see manual above
-

### Hardware Setup

Connect the Waveshare E-Paper display to the Raspberry Pi following the manufacturer's instructions.

## Usage

Clone or download the project repository to your Raspberry Pi

    git clone https://github.com/MaestroOnICe/quotes.git

Navigate to the project directory.

    cd quotes

Install the required Python packages by navigating to the python directory and installing required dependecies:

    pip install setup.py

Generate the bitmaps required for displaying the quotes using the generateBitMaps.py script. This script will generate bitmap files for each entry in the [quotes json file](./wise.json).

    python generateBitMaps.py

All 365 bitmaps should be in the /bmp folder

Option 1: Compile the C program using the provided Makefile in the C directory.

    sudo make clean
    sudo make
    sudo ./epd

Option 2: Run the Python script directly.

    python showQuotes.py

### Scheduling a Cron Job

To automatically refresh the E-Paper display at 3 AM every night, you can schedule a cron job on your Raspberry Pi. Here's how:

Open the cron table for editing.

    $ crontab -e

Add the following line to the cron table:


    0 3 * * * /path/to/python /path/to/showQuotes.py

Save and exit the cron table.

Cron will now execute the showQuotes.py script at 3 AM every day, refreshing the E-Paper display with a new quote.
